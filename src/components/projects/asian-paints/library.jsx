          While I've been in the regular habit of creating design libraries,
          this project was by far the largest and most comprehensive library I
          have worked on yet. We were brainstorming new ideas and tackling
          technical constraints in a very dynamic manner, which meant our design
          components evolved everyday. Shailija and I worked on maintaining and
          updating a buildable design library which allowed us to grab
          components and make changes to screens quickly.
